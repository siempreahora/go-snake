### Challenges

- Prettify the game frame
- Print an error message if the screen size is not big enough
- Print the score in real-time somewhere outside the game frame
- Change the game colors. I.E make the snake green and the apple red
- Make the apple "timed". It should regenerate itself after a given timeout
- Spawn apples and occassionally spawn "pears" which provide a higher score when eaten

## Extra Hard Challenges

- The terminal cell has higher height than width. Make the snake bigger by taking up two adjacent cells instead of one.
- Make a variant of the game where the snake reappears at the other end of the screen if it hits the wall
- Make the game dynamically adjust when the screen is resized
